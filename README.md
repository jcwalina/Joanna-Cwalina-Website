# Joanna Cwalina - Life Coach Website

**Joanna Cwalina - Life Coach** is a personal website I designed and developed to represent my life coaching services. As a life coach, I focus on helping individuals achieve personal growth, clarity, and balance in their lives. The website provides an overview of my coaching philosophy, services, and allows clients to easily book sessions or connect with me for guidance.

## Features

- **Personal Branding**: A custom design that reflects my values and coaching style—minimalistic, calm, and professional—to create a welcoming atmosphere for potential clients.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and ensures a seamless user experience across all devices, from desktop to mobile.
- **i18next Integration**: The website supports multiple languages using **i18next**, making it accessible to a broader audience. Visitors can easily switch between languages (e.g., Polish, German and English) for a more inclusive user experience.
- **Service Overview**: Clear descriptions of the life coaching services I offer, including personal coaching sessions and group workshops.
- **Booking System**: Integrated a user-friendly booking feature that allows clients to schedule coaching sessions directly from the website.
- **Client Testimonials**: A dedicated section to showcase client success stories and feedback to build trust and credibility.
